## Description
This project is based on the *Landing Page* starter code provided by Udacity for the *Front End Web Developer Nanodegree Program*.

To convert the static landing page to an interactive one, three main functions were added to the starter code.
These functions were added to the `js/app.js` file, which is referenced as the last element of the body of the `index.html` file.

## Functions:
### [1]: Dynamic generation of a navigation bar
test

### Scroll to section on navigation item click
test

### Visualize the currently focused section

## Open
Clone the repo or extract the .zip file and open the `index.html` file in your favorite browser.
